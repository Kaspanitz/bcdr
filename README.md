# [Zone Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-service-support?view=azuresql#azure-services-with-availability-zone-support)

- **Zonal services**: A resource can be deployed to a specific, **self-selected availability zone** to achieve more stringent latency or performance requirements. Resiliency is self-architected by replicating applications and data to one or more zones within the region. Resources are aligned to a selected zone. For example, virtual machines, managed disks, or standard IP addresses can be aligned to a same zone, which allows for increased resiliency by having multiple instances of resources deployed to different zones.
- **Zone-redundant services**: Resources are replicated or distributed across zones **automatically**. For example, zone-redundant services replicate the data across multiple zones so that a failure in one zone does not affect the high availability of the data.â€¯
- **Always-available services:** Always available across all Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages and region-wide outages. For a complete list of always-available services, also called non-regional services, in Azure, see Products available by region
