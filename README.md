# Business Continuity in Azure
> Applications do not necessarily have the availability (or recoverability) that we need, just because they are in the cloud. We do have more options to build resilience into our applications though.

## Availability

- [The Azure Global Infrastructure](https://infrastructuremap.microsoft.com/explore)
	- [Geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#overview)
	- [Regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview#regions)


- [Azure Reliability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/?view=azuresql "Azure Reliability")
	- [Region Pairs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/cross-region-replication-azure#azure-cross-region-replication-pairings-for-all-geographies)
	- [Availability Sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview)
	- [Availability Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview#availability-zones)

	- [Infographic](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/infographic-reliability-with-microsoft-azure/InfographicRC2.pdf)
	

- [Zone Definitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-service-support?view=azuresql#azure-services-with-availability-zone-support)
	- **Zonal services**: A resource can be deployed to a specific, **self-selected availability zone** to achieve more stringent latency or performance requirements. Resiliency is self-architected by replicating applications and data to one or more zones within the region. Resources are aligned to a selected zone. For example, virtual machines, managed disks, or standard IP addresses can be aligned to a same zone, which allows for increased resiliency by having multiple instances of resources deployed to different zones.
	- **Zone-redundant services**: Resources are replicated or distributed across zones **automatically**. For example, zone-redundant services replicate the data across multiple zones so that a failure in one zone does not affect the high availability of the data.â€¯
	- **Always-available services:** Always available across all Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages and region-wide outages. Also known as non-regional services e.g. Azure Active Directory.

## Disaster Recovery

### [Backup Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-overview)
- Unified management experience
- [Govern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-govern-environment), [monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-monitor-operate), [report](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-obtain-insights), and operate **Azure Backups** at scale 
	- across various dimensions: job status, policies, backup instances
	- across various scopes: vaults, resource groups, subscriptions, regions, and tenants (using Azure Lighthouse) 
- Monitor and manage **Azure Site Recovery** at scale
- [Support matrix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-support-matrix)

### [Azure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/)
![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/media/guidance-best-practices/azure-backup-architecture.png)

#### Vaults (2)
- [Recovery Services Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview)
	- Configuration information and backup data
	- [Redundancy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-create-recovery-services-vault#set-storage-redundancy)
		- LRS, GRS (6 copies across 2 paired regions), ZRS
		- Must be configured before protecting any workloads. Once a workload is protected in Recovery Services vault, the setting is locked and can't be changed.
		- Storage replication settings for vaults are not relevant for Azure file share backup, because the current solution is snapshot based and no data is transferred to the vault. Snapshots are stored in the same storage account as the backed-up file share.
	- [Key features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview#key-features), including:
		- [Cross Region Restore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#cross-region-restore): Restore Azure VMs in a secondary (paired) region. By enabling this feature at the vault level, you can restore the replicated data in the secondary region any time. This enables you to restore the secondary region data for audit-compliance, and during outage scenarios, without waiting for Azure to declare a disaster (unlike the GRS settings of the vault).
			- Enabling incurs charges
			- RPO:36 hours
		- **Cross-region backup** (i.e., back up a resource to a recovery services vault in a different region) is not supported for any Azure workload. 
- [Backup Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-vault-overview)
	- Backup data for certain newer workloads that Azure Backup supports e.g., PostgreSQL

#### Security (6)
- [Encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview#encryption-settings-in-the-recovery-services-vault) of data in transit and at rest
	- Within Azure, data in transit between Azure storage and the vault is protected by HTTPS. This data remains within the Azure network.
	- Backup data
		- Platform-managed keys (by default)
		- Customer-managed keys (stored in key vault)
	- [Azure VMs OS/data disks encrypted with Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is supported](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-encryption)
- [Soft delete (enhanced in preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-enhanced-soft-delete-about)
	- Deleted data is retained for a specified duration (14-180 days)
	- [Enhanced soft delete features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-enhanced-soft-delete-about#whats-enhanced-soft-delete) e.g., Always-on
- [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-rbac-rs-vault)
	- Backup Contributor - Permissions to create and manage backup except deleting Recovery Services vault and giving access to others. "Admin of backup operations"
	- Backup Operator - Contributor permissions except for removing backup and managing backup policies. Can't perform destructive operations such as stop backup with delete data or remove registration of on-premises resources.
	- Backup Reader - View all backup management operations. "Monitoring role"
- [Multi-user authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/multi-user-authorization-concept?tabs=backup-vault#how-does-mua-for-backup-work)
	- Additional protection on Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. Azure Backup uses another Azure resource called the Resource Guard to ensure critical operations are performed only with applicable authorization. Resource Guard must be owned by a different user.
[![](https://github.com/Kaspanitz/bcdr/blob/main/images/MUA.png)](https://github.com/Kaspanitz/bcdr/blob/main/images/MUA.png)
- [Immutable vault (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-immutable-vault-concept?tabs=recovery-services-vault)
	- Blocks specific operations on the vault and its protected items.
	- Disable/Enable/Enable and Lock (cannot be disabled)
	- Restricted operations e.g., Stop protection with delete data, Modify backup policy to reduce retention, Change backup policy to reduce retention
- Private endpoints
	- Bring backup service into VNET
	- [V1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/private-endpoints-overview) and 
	- [V2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-private-endpoints-concept) experience
		- Create private endpoints without managed identities.
		- No private endpoints are created for the blob and queue services.
		- Use of fewer private IPs.
