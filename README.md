# Business Continuity in Azure
`FTA Preview`

*Applications do not necessarily have the availability (or recoverability) that we need, just because they are in the cloud. We do have more options to build resilience into our applications though.*

[![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/media/shared-responsibility-model.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/media/shared-responsibility-model.png)

*Many of the offerings Azure provides require customers to architect for availability, and set up disaster recovery in multiple regions and are not the responsibility of Microsoft.*

*The many availability and disaster recovery options provide customers with the flexibility to choose an implementation that aligns to their application criticality requirements and budget considerations.*

## Availability
`Service-level agreement:` An availability target representing a commitment around performance and availability of an application.

- [The Azure Global Infrastructure](https://infrastructuremap.microsoft.com/explore)
	- [Geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#overview)
	- [Regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview#regions)

	- [Infographic](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/infographic-reliability-with-microsoft-azure/InfographicRC2.pdf)
	
- [Zone Definitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-service-support?view=azuresql#azure-services-with-availability-zone-support)
	- **Zonal services**: A resource can be deployed to a specific, **self-selected availability zone** to achieve more stringent latency or performance requirements. Resiliency is self-architected by replicating applications and data to one or more zones within the region. Resources are aligned to a selected zone. For example, virtual machines, managed disks, or standard IP addresses can be aligned to a same zone, which allows for increased resiliency by having multiple instances of resources deployed to different zones.
	- **Zone-redundant services**: Resources are replicated or distributed across zones **automatically**. For example, zone-redundant services replicate the data across multiple zones so that a failure in one zone does not affect the high availability of the data.â€¯
	- **Always-available services:** Always available across all Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages and region-wide outages. Also known as non-regional services e.g. Azure Active Directory.
- [Reliability by service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/reliability-guidance-overview?view=azuresql)
- [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services?lang=1) *The Microsoft commitment for uptime and connectivity for Microsoft Online Services*
	- [Composite SLAs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/business-metrics#composite-slas)

## Disaster Recovery
`Recovery Point Objective (RPO):` How much data can be lost?
`Recovery Time Objective (RTO):` How long can a service be down? The **expected** recovery time.
`Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD):` Total downtime before significant impact to the business. The **required** recovery time.

### [Backup Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-overview)
- Unified management experience
- [Govern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-govern-environment), [monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-monitor-operate), [report](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-obtain-insights), and operate **Azure Backups** at scale 
	- across various dimensions: job status, policies, backup instances
	- across various scopes: vaults, resource groups, subscriptions, regions, and tenants (using Azure Lighthouse) 
- Monitor and manage **Azure Site Recovery** at scale
- [Support matrix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-center-support-matrix)

### [Azure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/)
![](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/media/guidance-best-practices/azure-backup-architecture.png)

#### Vaults (2)
- [Recovery Services Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview)
	- Configuration information and backup data
	- [Redundancy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-create-recovery-services-vault#set-storage-redundancy)
		- **LRS** (low cost option recommended when Azure vault is not the primary/only store), **GRS** (6 copies across 2 paired regions), **ZRS**
		- Must be configured before protecting any workloads. Once a workload is protected in Recovery Services vault, the setting is locked and can't be changed.
		*Storage replication settings for vaults are not relevant for Azure file share backup, because the current solution is snapshot based and no data is transferred to the vault. Snapshots are stored in the same storage account as the backed-up file share.*
	- [Key features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview#key-features), including:
		- [Cross Region Restore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms#cross-region-restore): Restore Azure VMs in a secondary (paired) region. By enabling this feature at the vault level, you can restore the replicated data in the secondary region any time. This enables you to restore the secondary region data for audit-compliance, and during outage scenarios, without waiting for Azure to declare a disaster (unlike the GRS settings of the vault).
			- Must be enabled and incurs charges
			- `RPO: 36 hours`
		- **Cross-region backup** (i.e. back up a resource to a recovery services vault in a different region) is not supported for any Azure workload. 
- [Backup Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-vault-overview)
	- Backup data for certain newer Azure Backup workloads e.g. Azure Disks, Azure Blobs, PostgreSQL
	- Redundancy
		- **LRS**, **ZRS**, **GRS**

#### Security (6)
- [Encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview#encryption-settings-in-the-recovery-services-vault) of data in transit and at rest
	- Within Azure, data in transit between Azure storage and the vault is protected by HTTPS. This data remains within the Azure network.
	- Backup data
		- Platform-managed keys (by default)
		- Customer-managed keys (stored in key vault)
	- [Azure VMs OS/data disks encrypted with Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is supported](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-encryption)

	- **Backup Contributor** - Permissions to create and manage backup except deleting Recovery Services vault and giving access to others. "Admin of backup operations"
	- **Backup Operator** - Contributor permissions except for removing backup and managing backup policies. Can't perform destructive operations such as stop backup with delete data or remove registration of on-premises resources.
	- **Backup Reader** - View all backup management operations. "Monitoring role"
- [Multi-user authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/multi-user-authorization-concept?tabs=backup-vault#how-does-mua-for-backup-work)
	- Additional protection on Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. Azure Backup uses another Azure resource called the Resource Guard to ensure critical operations are performed only with applicable authorization. Resource Guard must be owned by a different user.
[![](https://github.com/Kaspanitz/bcdr/blob/main/images/MUA.png)](https://github.com/Kaspanitz/bcdr/blob/main/images/MUA.png)
- [Immutable vault (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-immutable-vault-concept?tabs=recovery-services-vault)
	- Blocks specific operations on the vault and its protected items.
	- Disable/Enable/Enable and Lock (cannot be disabled)
